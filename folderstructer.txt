//Below is some folder structure feel free to update to best fit MERN Stack

app dir -> app.js (primary React File Where Components are Required & Rendered)
			-> components dir (contains all react components)
			-> dummydata dir (just in case we need it)

config dir -> config.json (created when running sequelize cli)
			-> connection.js (connect sequelize to mysql not sure if needed?)

db dir -> schema.sql (contains the db modeling for mysql like models in mongoose)
		-> seeds.sql (dummy data to be input into mysql tables)

models dir -> was used with mongoose, though I believe sequelize cli creates one

public dir -> all public front end components
			-> index.html (React components work into file be div id)
			-> bundle.js (File generated each time webpack is run to render React)

routing dir -> all controller files could incoprate Express and React Router

webpack.config.js -> file that transpiles JSX and generates JS for bundle.js
